# AtoClicker
> An auto clicker for Windows.
***
# How to use it?
* First, it will ask for the delay after every click (The Speed). Leaving the option empty will set it to zero, which means zero seconds of delay after every click. You can also place a decimal value.
* After setting the speed, it will ask for seconds to wait before the auto clicker can start. Again, the default value is zero, which means it will start immediately.
* Remember, you can always quit by pressing the "End" key.
* Every time the auto clicker stops, it will ask if you want to continue or exit. Choose by typing (y/n) and enter to confirm.
